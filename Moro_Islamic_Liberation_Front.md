> The Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF; Arabic: جبهة تحرير مورو الإسلامية, romanized: Jabha Taḥrīr Moro al-ʾIslāmiyya) 
> is an Islamic armed group split from the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF), 
> was founded in 1977, based in Mindanao, Philippines, 
> which sought an autonomous region of the Moro people from the central government. 
> 
> The group has a presence in the Bangsamoro region of Mindanao, the Sulu Archipelago, Palawan, Basilan, and other neighbouring islands. 
> 
> The armed wing of the group was the Bangsamoro Islamic Armed Forces (BIAF), 
> although the name of its parent organization, the MILF, was often used to refer to the BIAF.
>
> In July 2018, the Philippine government passed the Bangsamoro Organic Law, 
> giving more autonomy to Muslims. 
> 
> In return, MILF announced that it would disarm its 30,000 fighters.
