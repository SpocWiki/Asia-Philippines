> The Philippine–American War, known alternatively as the Filipino–American War, Philippine Insurrection,  or Tagalog Insurgency, emerged in early 1899 
> when the United States forcibly annexed 
> the former Spanish colony of the Philippine Islands 
> under the terms of the Treaty of Paris, signed in December 1898. 
> 
> Concurrently, Philippine nationalists had proclaimed independence 
> and, eight months later, constituted the First Philippine Republic. 
> The United States did not recognize either event as legitimate, 
> and tensions escalated until fighting commenced on February 4, 1899, in the Battle of Manila.
>
> Shortly after being denied a request for an armistice, 
> the Philippine government issued a proclamation on June 2, 1899, 
> urging the people to continue the war. 
> 
> Philippine forces initially attempted to engage U.S. forces conventionally 
> but transitioned to guerrilla tactics by November 1899. 
> 
> Philippine President Emilio Aguinaldo was captured on March 23, 1901, 
> and the war was officially declared over by the US on July 4, 1902. 
> 
> However, some Philippine groups – some led by veterans of the Katipunan, 
> including Macario Sakay, 
> a revolutionary society that had launched the revolution against Spain – 
> continued to fight for several more years. 
> 
> Other groups, including the Muslim Moro peoples of the southern Philippines 
> and quasi-Catholic Pulahan religious movements, continued hostilities in remote areas. 
> The resistance in the Moro-dominated provinces in the south, 
> called the Moro Rebellion by the Americans, 
> ended with their final defeat at the Battle of Bud Bagsak on June 15, 1913.
>
> The war resulted in at least 200,000 Filipino civilian deaths, 
> mostly from famine and diseases, 
> including at least 150,000 deaths in a cholera epidemic towards the end of the war. 
> 
> Some estimates for civilian deaths reach up to a million. 
> War crimes were committed during the conflict, including rape, torture, mutilation, 
> and summary executions of civilians and prisoners. 
> 
> In retaliation for Filipino guerrilla warfare tactics, 
> the U.S. carried out reprisals and scorched earth campaigns 
> and forcibly relocated many civilians to concentration camps, where thousands died. 
> 
> The war and subsequent occupation by the U.S. changed the culture of the islands, 
> leading to the rise of Protestantism, disestablishment of the Catholic Church, 
> and the adoption of English by the islands 
> as the primary language of government, education, business, and industry. 
> 
> The U.S. annexation and war 
> sparked a political backlash from anti-imperialists in the U.S. Senate, 
> who argued that the war was a definite example of U.S. imperialism, 
> and that it was an inherent contradiction of the founding principles of the United States 
> contained in the Declaration of Independence.
>
> In 1902, the United States Congress passed the Philippine Organic Act, 
> which provided for the creation of the Philippine Assembly, 
> with members to be elected by Filipino men (women did not yet have the right to vote). 
> 
> This act was superseded by the 1916 Jones Act (Philippine Autonomy Act), 
> which contained the first formal and official declaration 
> of the United States government's commitment 
> to eventually grant independence to the Philippines. 
> 
> The 1934 Tydings–McDuffie Act (Philippine Independence Act) 
> created the Commonwealth of the Philippines the following year. 
> 
> The act increased self-governance and established a process towards full independence 
> (originally scheduled for 1944, but delayed by World War II 
> and the Japanese occupation of the Philippines). 
> 
> The United States eventually withdrew from the country 
> and recognized Philippine independence in 1946 through the Treaty of Manila.
